# My-First-Blog

My-First-Blog is my introduction to the Django framework for Python using the DjangoGirls tutoral. 
It taught me the basics of:

  - How to use the Admin interface.
  - How to create a model, manipulate it in the views, and then display it in a template.
  - The regex behind the urls in django.
  - How to add logic to my templates using Django's custome template tags.
  - How to create a form and display it in a template.
  - How to import data for everything one needs to perform basic actions using Python.
  - Where to add CSS.
  
I am continuing the tutorial and intend to modify and personalize it more.
